############################################# 

# The most basic ingredient in an Alchemy recipe, lead is used in all
# recipes in this repository to standardize some simple things that I
# rely on to make scripts concise and pleasant to use

# --------------- Escape Codes ---------------
# These constants are used to add color and text formatting to the
# terminal's output -- Further reading: ANSI Escape Codes
RED="\e[0;31m"
GREEN="\e[0;32m"
BLUE="\e[0;34m"
BOLD="\e[1m"
ULINE="\e[4m"
RESET="\e[0m"

# --------------- Traps ---------------

# Traps, in the case of shell scripting, listen for certain signals 
# that are broadcast by the system and execute a command in response

# We only want these to activate if we're running a recipe
if [[ $SHLVL -gt 1 ]]; then
    # Make sure that ctrl+C consistently exits the script
    trap "exit" INT 
    # Give informative error messages when we receive ERR
    trap 'echo -e "${RED}Oops...${RESET} Something went wrong on line $LINENO of this script. Exit code was $?" >&2' ERR
fi


# --------------- Environment Setup ---------------

# If there's an env file, export it's contents to the environment
if [ -f .env ]; then
    export $(grep -v '^#' .env | xargs)
else
    if [ -z $ALCHEMY ]; then
        echo "No .env file, this might cause some issues..."

fi


# --------------- Functions ---------------

# Coding Moment: generally, whenever you see something with brackets
# at the end of it, like this() or like(this), it's a function!
# It takes inputs and gives (or does) something as an output

# Checks to see if we can use a command or not

    command -v "$1" >/dev/null
