        <p>Flask parsed it and passed it as a parameter to the

        which is located in the directory where you installed Flask</p>
        <p>It also imports the css as a file in the <tt>static/</tt>

        <p>There's plenty to learn about Flask! Hopefully this gives you

      your first name in the URL, or click <a href="/beautiful%20human">here</a> 
      for a demonstration of URL parsing.</p>
